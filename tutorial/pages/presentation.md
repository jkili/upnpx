> UPnP specifications: _"If a device has a URL for presentation, then the control point can retrieve a page from this URL, load the page into a browser and, depending on the capabilities of the page, allow a user to control the device and/or view device status. The degree to which each of these can be accomplished depends on the specific capabilities of the presentation page and device."_
